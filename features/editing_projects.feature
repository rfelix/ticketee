Feature: Editing Projects
  In order to update project information
  As a user
  I want to be ab√ße to do that through an interface

  Background:
    Given there is a project called "TextMate 2"
    And I am on the homepage
    When I follow "TextMate 2"
    And I follow "Edit"

  Scenario: Updating a project
    When I fill in "Name" with "TextMate 2 beta"
    And I press "Update Project"
    Then I should see "Project has been updated."
    Then I should be on the project page for "TextMate 2 beta"

  Scenario: Updating a project with invalide attributes is bad
    When I fill in "Name" with ""
    And I press "Update Project"
    Then I should see "Project has not been updated."
